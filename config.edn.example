{task-description}
```

Please answer with either \"yes\" or \"no\" â€” does this task, with the current description and with reasonable interpretation from an average programmer, classify as a \"next action\", in the sense of GTD/Getting Things Done?

A Next Action should be:
- A specific, concrete physical action
- Clear about what exactly needs to be done
- Actionable right now without dependencies
- Not vague or abstract

Examples of Next Actions:
- \"Call caterer to confirm menu\"
- \"Email John about Q3 report\"  
- \"Draft agenda for team meeting\"
- \"Research competitor websites for design inspiration\"
- \"Take out trash bags to the curb\"

What is NOT a Next Action:
- Vague tasks: \"Think about marketing strategy\" or \"Improve website\"
- Projects: \"Organize garage\" (instead: \"Sort garage items into keep/donate/trash piles\")
- Waiting tasks: \"Wait for Sarah's approval\" (instead: \"Email Sarah to ask for approval\")
- Tasks requiring prerequisites: \"Deploy to production\" when code isn't ready

Consider the task content and description. Does this specify a clear, actionable next step that could be started immediately?"}}
