```
{task-content}

{task-description}
```

Does this task qualify as a \"next action\" in the GTD sense - something actionable you could start working on right now?

A Next Action in software development should be:
- Specific enough to start coding/implementing without needing clarification
- Scoped to something achievable in one focused work session
- Not blocked by other work that must be done first
- Clear on the technical change being requested

Examples of Next Actions in software:
- \"Add isDefault boolean flag to Run parameters model\"
- \"Update API endpoint to return version field\"
- \"Write migration to add tags column to runners table\"
- \"Refactor authentication middleware to use new token format\"
- \"Fix bug where logout doesn't clear session cookie\"

What is NOT a Next Action:
- Too vague: \"Improve performance\", \"Fix issues\", \"Add metrics\" with no details
- Lacks specifics: \"Update model\" without saying which fields or how
- Multi-step projects: \"Build user authentication system\" (break into smaller tasks)
- Has sub-issues: If noted as having sub-issues, it's a project/epic, not a next action
- Requires design decisions: Tasks that describe a problem but not the specific solution
- Blocked: \"Deploy feature X\" when feature X isn't finished yet

Evaluation criteria:
- If the task has no description and the title is vague (like \"Metrics for debugging later\"), answer NO
- If the task describes a problem but not a specific solution (\"we need to show X\" without saying how), answer NO
- If the task is noted as having sub-issues, answer NO - it's a project
- Only answer YES if you could reasonably start writing code without asking clarifying questions

Does this task specify something you could start implementing right now?"}}
